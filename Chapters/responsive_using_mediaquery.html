                        belonging to the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. Cley Marshes protects an
                        area of reed beds, freshwater marsh, pools and wet meadows, and has
                        been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the
                        large flocks of birds it attracts. The reserve is important for some
                        scarce breeding species, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western
                        marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds,

                        several nationally or locally scarce invertebrates and plants specialised
                        for this coastal habitat. The reserve has an environmentally friendly
                        visitor centre and five bird hides, and attracts large numbers of visitors,
                         contributing significantly to the economy of Cley village. Despite centuries
                        to reclaim land and protect the village, the marshes have been
                        flooded many times; the southward march of the coastal shingle b
